## Software Developer Income Predictor
This project aims to predict the income of software developers based on various features such as education level, years of experience, programming languages known, and geographic location. The predictive model is built using machine learning techniques and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview
Software developers' income prediction is a crucial task for both job seekers and employers. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence developers' income and build a predictive model that can estimate income based on given features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about software developers, including their education level, years of experience, programming languages known, geographic location, and income. The dataset was collected from stackoverflow and preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning modeling.

## Dependencies
